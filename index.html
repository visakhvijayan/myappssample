        The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization that aims to
        maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations
        among nations, achieve international cooperation, and be a centre for
        harmonizing the actions of nations. The organization's mission to
        preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold
        War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective
        allies. Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military
        observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring, reporting
        and confidence-building roles.[6] UN membership grew significantly
        following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s. Since then,
        80 former colonies have gained independence, including 11 trust
        territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council.[7] By
        the 1970s, the UN's budget for economic and social development
        programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end
        of the Cold War, the UN shifted and expanded its field operations,
        undertaking a wide variety of complex tasks.[8]
