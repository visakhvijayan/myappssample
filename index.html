        The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization that aims to
        maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations
        among nations, achieve international cooperation, and be a centre for
        harmonizing the actions of nations. The organization's mission to
        preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold
        War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective
        allies. Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military
        observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring, reporting
        and confidence-building roles.[6] UN membership grew significantly
        following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s. Since then,
        80 former colonies have gained independence, including 11 trust
        territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council.[7] By
        the 1970s, the UN's budget for economic and social development
        programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end
        of the Cold War, the UN shifted and expanded its field operations,
        undertaking a wide variety of complex tasks.[8]

        The UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly; the Security
        Council; the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); the Trusteeship
        Council; the International Court of Justice; and the UN Secretariat. The
        UN System includes a multitude of specialized agencies, such as the
        World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food
        Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. Additionally, non-governmental
        organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other
        agencies to participate in the UN's work. The UN's chief administrative
        officer is the Secretary-General, currently Portuguese politician and
        diplomat Ant√≥nio Guterres, who began his five year-term on 1 January
        2017. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary
        contributions from its member states.
